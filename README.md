Data mangling, mostly. 

1. parseCitekey parses Zotero citekeys. [link](1-parsecitekey)

2. zoteroPhosoImport manually batch imports folders containing photo files by renaming files to match the folder, reading related information from a text file in the folder, manually creating a Zotero RDF file that preserves attachment links, and creating a markdown file for any photo albums for use for use in Obsidian.
